# Internship Application — On-site (Noida)

**Name:** Premsagar Dhote  
**Location:** Bhopal, India  
**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/premsagar-dhote-02a00a195/  
**Email:** premsagardhote2002@gmail.com  

## Why I’m a good fit
- Strong background in analog, digital, and mixed-signal circuit design through M.Tech research at NIT Rourkela.  
- Hands-on experience with industry-standard EDA tools like Cadence Virtuoso and Synopsys Sentaurus, and solid programming skills in C/C++, Verilog, and Python.  
- Practical experience in Computer Organization & Architecture, digital system design, and Linux-based development environments.  
- Highly motivated, detail-oriented, and available for full-time on-site internship in Noida.  

## Relevant skills & tools
- Cadence Virtuoso | Synopsys Sentaurus | Verilog HDL | C/C++ | Python | MATLAB | TCL scripting  
- Analog/Mixed-signal design | Digital design | Device-to-circuit integration | Compute-in-Memory architectures  
- Computer Organization & Architecture | Static Timing Analysis | I2C/SPI Protocols  
- Linux command-line operations | Scripting for automation  

## Projects / Examples
- **Variability-Aware FeFET-Based Nanosheet Non-Volatile Memories** — Modeled and validated device and circuit behavior, enabling stable multi-bit operations for CIM applications.  
- **Temperature-Independent Bandgap Voltage Reference** — Designed in Cadence Virtuoso to meet strict supply voltage and temperature stability requirements.  
- **Asynchronous FIFO Using Verilog** — Developed a parameterized FIFO for differing read/write frequencies, addressing metastability and ensuring reliable clock domain crossing.  

## Eligibility confirmation
I confirm I have not held any prior paid employment or paid internship and I am available for an on-site internship in Noida.
